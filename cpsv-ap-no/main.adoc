Welcome to the showroom with demo services and events, demonstrating the usage of CPSV-AP-NO!

_https://informasjonsforvaltning.github.io/cpsv-ap-no/[CPSV-AP-NO ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (#currently as a trial version#) is the the Norwegian application profile of https://github.com/SEMICeu/CPSV-AP[EU's Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"], for describing services and events._

image:../images/work-in-progress.png[WIP,72,72] _This showroom is under construction and will be finalized as soon as practically possible after the finalizing of CPSV-AP-NO._ 

== Purpose [[purpose]]

This showroom is meant to 

* demonstrate how to use CPSV-AP-NO to describe services and events;
* demonstrate some cross-references between services/events and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms;
* provide reusable, machine-readable descriptions of services and events, for testing and demonstration purposes.

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo services and events are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world phenomena at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to CPSV-AP-NO._ 


== Demo resources in this showroom [[demo-resources]]

In this showroom we have a https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-services-events[catalog of demo services and demo events] (in link:files/demo-services-events.ttl[RDF Turtle]): 

* #_... more to come ..._#

 
== Some cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

*_Note_*: _Not all possible cross-references are demonstrated in this showroom. The lists are thus not exhaustive._

*Services/events and classifications*, for example: 

* When describing a service/event/etc., and where coded values are used, the coded values should preferably be chosen from controlled vocabularies (i.e., classifications). 
** _#... more to come ...#_  

*Services/events and concepts*, for example: 

* A service/event/etc., may refer to concepts that are relevant for understanding the service/event/etc.  
** _#... more to come ...#_  

*Services/events and datasets*, for example: 

* An evidence that is needed in order to execute a service, may be a dataset. 
**  _#... more to come ...#_

* A service may produce a dataset as the output. 
**  _#... more to come ...#_

* An event is a dataset. 
**  _#... more to come ...#_

*Services/events and information models*, for example: 

* An evidence that is needed to execute a service, or the output from a service, may a dataset and thus may conform to one or more standards (incl. information models).
** This is demonstrated and explained in our link:../dcat-ap-no[showroom with demo datasets].
