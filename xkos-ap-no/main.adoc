Welcome to the showroom with demo classifications, demonstrating the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no[XKOS-AP-NO, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (the Norwegian application profile of XKOS for describing and publishing classifications (controlled vocabularies))! 

== Purpose [[purpose]]

This showroom is meant to

* demonstrate machine-readable descriptions of a classification and the categories it contains, in accordance with XKOS-AP-NO
* demonstrate some cross-references between classifications and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms
* provided reusable, machine-readable classifications with  referenceable categories, for testing and demonstration purposes 

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo classifications and its demo categories are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world phenomena at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to XKOS-AP-NO._


== Demo resources [[explanations]]

In this showroom we have a https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications[demo classification with its demo categories]. 


<<img-demo-classification>> illustrates graphically the demo classification,  its demo categories and relations between them.

As illustrated in the figure, this classification, called "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoClassification1[Demo controlled vocabulary 1]" has: 

* two classification levels, "Demo level 1" and "Demo level 2"
** "	
https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoLev1[Demo level 1]" contains categories "Demo category A" and "Demo category B"
** "	
https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoLev2[Demo level 2]" contains categories "Demo category A.1" and "Demo category A.2"
* "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-A[Demo category A]" is further specialized into (at "Demo level 2") categories "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-A1[Demo category A.1]" and "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-A2[Demo category A.2]". 
** "Demo category A" represents, and thus also refers to, "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1[Demo concept 1]". Similarly "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-B[Demo category B]" representing/referring to "https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1[demo concept 2]", etc. 


== Cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

A classification with its categories, may and should be considered as a dataset. Please visit our https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/dcat-ap-no/[showroom with demo datasets], where we demonstrate how to make this demo classification https://demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/datasets?q=demodataset[findable via the demo catalog]. 

A classification may refer to: 

* A concept _#... more to come ...#_ 
* _#... more to come ...#_ 

A classification may be referred to from:

* A dataset _#... more to come ...#_ 
* An information model _#... more to come ...#_ 
* A service or an event _#... more to come ...#_ 
* _#... more to come ...#_
