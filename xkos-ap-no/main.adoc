Welcome to the showroom with demo classifications, demonstrating the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no[XKOS-AP-NO, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]! 

XKOS-AP-NO is the Norwegian application profile of XKOS for describing and publishing classifications, controlled vocabularies, code lists etc. 

== The purpose [[purpose]]

This showroom is meant to

* demonstrate machine-readable descriptions of classifications, classification levels and categories, in accordance with XKOS-AP-NO;
* demonstrate some cross-references between classifications and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms;
* provided reusable, machine-readable classifications with  referenceable categories, for testing and demonstration purposes. 

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo classifications and demo categories are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world phenomena. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to XKOS-AP-NO._


== The demo resources [[explanations]]

In this showroom we have a demo https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no#Klassifikasjon[classification] with its https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no#Klassifikasjonsniv%C3%A5[classification levels] and https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no#Kategori[categories],  illustrated in <<img-demo-classification>>.

Our demo classification, called https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoClassification1["Demo controlled vocabulary 1"], has: 

* two classification levels, https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoLev1["Demo level 1"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoLev2["Demo level 2"].
** "Demo level 1" contains categories https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-A["Demo category A"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-B["Demo category B"].
** "Demo level 2" contains https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-A1["Demo category A.1"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demo-category-A2["Demo category A.2"].
* "Demo category A" generalizes "Demo category A.1" and "Demo category A.2" .
** "Demo category A.1" specializes "Demo category A".
** "Demo category A.2" specializes "Demo category A".
* "Demo category A" should be presented before "Demo category B".
* "Demo category A.1" should be presented before "Demo category A.2".


== Some cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

Classifications and concepts: 

* A category in a classification is usually a concept. The definition of the concept should preferably be published outside and independently of the classification, although XKOS-AP-NO allows to define the concept as a part of the category description. 
** Our "Demo category A" represents, and thus also refers to from this demo classification, https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1["demo concept 1"] (demonstrated in https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/skos-ap-no/[the showroom with demo concepts]). Similarly, "Demo category B" represents and refers to https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt2["demo concept 2"], "Demo category A.1" represents and refers to https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt11["demo concept 11"], and "Demo category A.2" represents and refers to https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt12["demo concept 12"].

Classifications and datasets:

* A classification with its categories is a dataset, and should be made available machine-readably. 
** In https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/dcat-ap-no/[the showroom with demo datasets], we demonstrate how to describe this demo classification as machine-readable open dataset, and to make it https://demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/datasets?q=demodataset[findable via the demo catalog].
