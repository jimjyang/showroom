Welcome to the showroom for https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no[XKOS-AP-NO, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (the Norwegian application profile of XKOS for describing and publishing classifications (controlled vocabularies))! 

== Demo classifications 

We have here a link:files/demo-classifications.ttl[RDF Turtle file] with a demo classification illustrating the usage of XKOS-AP-NO:

* The demo classification is openly available as an open dataset and #will be# listed/described in and made findable via link:../docs/demo-catalog.adoc[the demo catalog].
* These demo classification is meant
** to demonstrate machine-readable description of a classification and the categories it contains, in accordance with XKOS-AP-NO
** to demonstrate some cross-references between classifications and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms
** to be provided as reusable, machine-readable classification, for testing and demonstration purposes
