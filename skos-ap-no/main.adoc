In this part of the showroom we will demonstrate the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[the Norwegian application profile of SKOS (SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep)] for describing and publishing concepts and concept collections. 

We have here 

* a https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimjyang/showroom/main/skos-ap-no-begrep/catalog-of-demo-concepts.ttl[RDF Turtle file] with demo concepts illustrating the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep]
** The demo concepts will be automatically harvested to and thus published via the demo catalog, after the catalog is modified to harvesting concept descriptions in accordance with v.2 of https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep].
** These demo concepts are currently meant to 
*** demonstrate how to describe concepts in accordance with https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep].
*** demonstrate how to describe relations between concepts, in accordance with  https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep].   
*** be referenced to as machine-readable RDF resources, for testing and demonstration purposes.
