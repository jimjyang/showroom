Welcome to the showroom with demo concepts, demonstrating the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]! 

SKOS-AP-NO is the Norwegian application profile of https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/[SKOS, window="_blank", role="ext-link"], for describing and publishing concepts and concept collections.

== The purpose [[purpose]]

This showroom is meant to

* demonstrate machine-readable concept descriptions in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x;
* demonstrate in particular how to describe concept relations, in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x;
* demonstrate some cross-references between concepts and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms;
* provide reusable, machine-readable concept descriptions, for testing and demonstration purposes.

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo concepts are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world concepts at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x._ 


== The demo resources [[demo-resources]]

In this showroom we have a https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts[collection of demo concepts] (in link:files/demo-concepts.ttl[RDF Turtle]):

* The demo concepts #will be# automatically harvested to and thus also (#not yet#) be findable via https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/#about-demo-catalog[the demo catalog].
* There are seven demo concepts in the collection, where
** https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1["demo concept 1"] generalizes https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt11["demo concept 11"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt12["demo concept 12"] (generic relations)
*** "demo concept 11" specializes "demo concept 1"
*** "demo concept 12" specializes "demo concept 1"
** https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt2["demo concept 2"] contains https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt21["demo concept 21"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt22["demo concept 22"] (partitive relations)
***  "demo concept 21" is part of  "demo concept 2"
***  "demo concept 22" is part of  "demo concept 2"
** https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt3["demo concept 3"] illustrates the usage of all _syntactically_ possible relations that a concept may have with other concepts. 

=== Concept relations

==== Hierarchical concept relations [[hierarchical-relations]]

There are two types of hierarchical concept relations: generic and partitive. 

<<img-hierarchical-relations>> illustrates some of the hierarchically relations between the demo concepts that are in the above mentioned collection of demo concepts. 

[[img-hierarchical-relations]]
.Two ways to describe hierarchical relations. 
[link=images/hierarchical-relations-explanations.png]
image::images/hierarchical-relations-explanations.png[alt="Figure with hierarchical relations. The content is explained in the text."]

The figure illustrates in particular the two different ways of describing hierarchical concept relations, in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x: 

* The straightforward way, when there is no need for specifying the criterion of subdivision: 
** by using the property "specializes" (`xkos:specializes`) or "generalizes" (`xkos:generalizes`) for generic concept relations, demonstrated by the generic relations between https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1["demo concept 1"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt11["demo concept 11"]
** by using the property "has part" (`xkos:hasPart`) or "is part of" (`xkos:isPartOf`) for partitive concept relations, demonstrated by the partitive relations between https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt2["demo concept 2"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt21["demo concept 21"]
* Via an instance of generic/partitive concept relation, when there is a need for specifying the criterion of subdivision: 
** by using the property "has generic concept relation"(`skosno:hasGenericConceptRelation`) for generic concept relations, demonstrated by the generic relations between https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1["demo concept 1"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt12["demo concept 12"]
** by using the property "has partitive concept relation" (`skosno:hasPartitiveConceptRelation`) for partitive concept relations, demonstrated by the partitive relations between https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt2["demo concept 2"] and https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt22["demo concept 22"] 
 
==== Associative concept relations [[associative-relations]]

While there are only two types of hierarchical concept relations as demonstrated above, there is an unlimited number of types associative concept relations. 

In SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep, some types of associative relations are explicitly supported, demonstrated by https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt3["demo concept 3"]:

* replaces (`dct:replaces`) / is replaced by (`dct:isReplacedBy`)
* has close match with (`skos:closeMatch)`
* has exact match with (`skos:exactMatch`)
* see also (`rdfs:seeAlso`)

SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep of course also allows you to specify your own types of associative concept relations, by using the property "is from-concept in" (`skosno:isFromConceptIn`) which refers to an instance of the class "Associative concept relation" (`skosno:AssociativeConceptRelation`). This is also demonstrated by https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt3["demo concept 3"]. 

=== Concept definitions [[definition]]

There are also two different ways to specify the definition of a given concept: 

* The straightforward way, when there is no need for more details about the definition, by using the property "definition (direct statement)" (`skos:definition`), demonstrated by e.g. https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1["demo concept 1"].
* Via an instance of the class Definition (`euvoc:XlNote`), when there is a need for more details about the definition, by using the property "definition (via definition object)" (`euvoc:xlDefinition`). This is demonstrated by https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt2["demo concept 2"], where details about the source and the audience of the definition are given. 

== Some cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

*_Note_*: _Not all possible cross-references are demonstrated in this showroom. The lists are thus not exhaustive._

Concepts and classifications, for example:

* A concept may refer to a classification as its value range. 
** Our https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt2["demo concept 2"], refers to our https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-classifications#demoClassification1["demo controlled vocabulary 1"] (demonstrated in our https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/xkos-ap-no/[showroom with demo classificatinos]) as its "value range" (`skosno:valueRange`).
* A concept may be included or referred to from a classification. 
** This is demonstrated in our https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/xkos-ap-no/[showroom with demo classificatinos]. 

Concepts and datasets, for example:

* _#... more to come ...#_ 

Concepts and information models, for example:

* _#... more to come ...#_ 

Concepts and services/events, for example:

* _#... more to come ...#_
