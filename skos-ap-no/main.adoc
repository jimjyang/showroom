Welcome to the showroom for https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (the Norwegian application profile of SKOS for describing and publishing concepts and concept collections)! 

== Demo concepts 

We have here a link:files/demo-concepts.ttl[RDF Turtle file] with demo concepts illustrating the usage of SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep:

* The demo concepts #(when the demo catalog conforms to v.2 of SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep) will be# automatically harvested to and thus published via link:../docs/demo-catalog.adoc[the demo catalog].
* These demo concepts are meant
** to demonstrate machine-readable descriptions in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x
** to demonstrate in particular how to describe concept relations, in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x
** to demonstrate some cross-references between concepts and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms
** to be provided as reusable, machine-readable concept descriptions, for testing and demonstration purposes 

== Some explanations of the demo concepts

*Disclaimer*: The machine-readable demo concepts are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world concepts at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x. 

=== Explanation - associative concept relations

_#... more to come ...#_ 

=== Explanation - hierarchical concept relations

<<img-hierarchical-relations>> illustrates some of the hierarchically relations between the demo concepts that are in the above mentioned RDF Turtle file. 

[[img-hierarchical-relations]]
.Tows of describing hierarchical relations.

image::images/hierarchical-relations-explanations.png[alt="Figure with hierarchical relations. The content is explained in the text."]

The figure illustrates in particular the two different ways of describing hierarchical concept relations, in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep v.2.x: 

*  _#... more to come ...#_  
 
== Cross-reference with other demo resources

A concept may be referred to from:

* A classification (controlled vocabulary) _#... more to come ...#_ 
* A dataset _#... more to come ...#_ 
* A information model _#... more to come ...#_ 
* A service of an event _#... more to come ...#_ 
* _#... more to come ...#_ 

A concept may refer to: 

* A classification (controlled vocabulary) _#... more to come ...#_ 
* _#... more to come ...#_
