Welcome to the showroom for https://data.norge.no/specification/skos-ap-no-begrep[SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep] (the Norwegian application profile of SKOS for describing and publishing concepts and concept collections)! 

== Overview 

We have here a link:files/demo-concepts.ttl[RDF Turtle file] with demo concepts illustrating the usage of SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep

* The demo concepts will be automatically harvested to and thus published via the demo catalog, after the catalog is modified to harvesting concept descriptions in accordance with v.2 of SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep.
* These demo concepts are currently meant to 
** demonstrate how to describe concepts in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep.
** demonstrate how to describe relations between concepts, in accordance with SKOS-AP-NO-Begrep.   
*** be referenced to as machine-readable RDF resources, for testing and demonstration purposes.
