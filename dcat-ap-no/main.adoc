Welcome to the showroom with demo datasets, demonstrating the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no[DCAT-AP-NO ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]! 

_DCAT-AP-NO is the Norwegian application profile of EU's https://github.com/SEMICeu/BregDCAT-AP[BRegDCAT-AP ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"], for describing datasets, data services and data catalogs._ 

== Purpose [[purpose]] 

This showroom is meant to 

* demonstrate how to use DCAT-AP-NO to describe a dataset and publish the description in a data portal such that the dataset is findable via the data portal;
* demonstrate some cross-references between datasets and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms;
* provide reusable, machine-readable datasets and dataset descriptions, for testing and demonstration purposes.

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo datasets are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world phenomena at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to DCAT-AP-NO._ 

== Demo resources in this showroom [[demo-resources]]

In this showroom we have a https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-datasets#demoDataset1[demo dataset, called "Demo controlled vocabulary 1"] (in link:files/demo-datasets.ttl[RDF Turtle]):

* The dataset description shown here, describes the demo classification called "Demo controlled vocabulary 1" that is demonstrated in our https://jimjyang.github.io/showroom/xkos-ap-no/[showroom with demo classifications]. 
** This is because a classification with its categories _is_ a dataset.   
** The difference is: The showroom here illustrates how to describe a dataset in accordance with DCAT-AP-NO, while the other showroom illustrates how to make available the dataset itself. 
* The demo dataset (= our demo classification) is here described as an open dataset, i.e., 
** freely available, with https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no#Datasett-tilgangsniv%C3%A5[access rights (dct:accessRights) ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] set to "public", and 
** with three https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no#Datasett-datasettdistribusjon[distributions ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] under https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no#Distribusjon-lisens[licence ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] CC0 which is an open licence.
* The three distributions are: 
** one https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-datasets#demoDistribution1[machine-readable] (https://data.norge.no/specification/dcat-ap-no#Distribusjon-format[format (dct:format) ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] = RDF_TURTLE), 
** one https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-datasets#demoDistribution2[human-readable in Norwegian bokmål] (format = HTML), and 
** another https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-datasets#demoDistribution3[human-readable in English] (format = HTML).

* This dataset description is automatically harvested to and thus https://demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/datasets?q=demodataset[findable via the demo portal ↗, window="_blank", role="ext-link"].
 
== Some cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

*_Note_*: _Not all possible cross-references are demonstrated in this showroom. The lists are thus not exhaustive._
