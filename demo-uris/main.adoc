Welcome to the showroom with dereferenced demo URIs, demonstrating a possible implementation of https://www.digdir.no/standarder/peikarar-til-offentlege-ressursar-pa-nett/1492[the Norwegian URI-standard, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]! 

== The purpose [[purpose]]

This showroom is meant to

* demonstrate a possible pattern of URIs, in accordance with the Norwegian URI-standard;
* demonstrate a possible way to implement permanent and dereferenced URIs. 

== The demo resources [[demo-resources]]

In this showroom we demonstrate how to use the service for permanent URIs provided by https://w3id.org[w3id.org, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]. 

=== URI-pattern

The above-mentioned Norwegian URI-standard defines the following pattern for URIs: 

[no-bullet]
* `http(s)://{domain}/{optional(type)}/{optional(concept)}/{object_identifier}`

Using w3id.org, our demo URI-pattern is as follows: 

* `{domain}` = `w3id.org` 
* `{optional(type)}` = `demo-resources`
* `{optional(concept)}` omitted
* `{object_identifier}` 
** = `demo-classifications#demo-category-A` for our "Demo category A"
** = `demo-concepts#demoCpt1` for our "demo concept 1"
** = `demo-datasets#demoDataset1` for our "Demo controlled vocabulary 1"
** = `demo-models#demomodel1` for our "Demo model 1"
** etc. 

=== Dereferencing URIs with content negotiation

According to https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#representation-management[W3C], "a URI owner SHOULD provide representations of the resource it identifies". 

We use the services provided by w3id.org, and define https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/tree/master/demo-resources[RewriteRules for dereferencing our demo URIs, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]. 

We also use the services provided by w3id.org to implement content negotiation  (incl. language negotiation), such that the same URI may return RDF Turtle or HTML in the preferred language, depending on "who's asking".

For example, for the URI `\https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-concepts#demoCpt1`: 

* `Accept: text/turtle` will redirect the request to the RDF Turtle representation of the resource identified by that URI.

* `Accept-language: nb` will redirect to the HTML representation in Norwegian bokm√•l, of the resource identified by that URI.

* `Accept-language: en` will redirect to the HTML representation in English, of the resource identified by that URI.

== Why are permanent URIs important?

ChatGPT gave (2023-03-30) the following answer to the above question: 


"A permanent URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), also known as a permanent link or a persistent identifier, is essential for the long-term accessibility and reliability of online resources. Here are some reasons why permanent URIs are important:

   .  Accessibility: A permanent URI ensures that a resource can be accessed and linked to over time. This is especially important for scholarly articles, research data, and other digital resources that need to be available for a long time.

   .  Stability: A permanent URI helps maintain the stability of links over time. Without a permanent URI, links to resources can break, making it difficult or impossible for users to access them.

    . Citation: A permanent URI provides a way to cite digital resources in academic and research publications, making it easier for readers to locate and access the cited material.

    . Reputation: A permanent URI helps establish the reputation of a digital resource by providing a persistent link to it that can be used to track its usage and impact over time.

    . SEO: A permanent URI can also have SEO (Search Engine Optimization) benefits, as search engines consider the stability and longevity of links when ranking search results.

Overall, a permanent URI is crucial for ensuring the long-term accessibility and reliability of digital resources, as well as for facilitating citation, reputation, and SEO."
