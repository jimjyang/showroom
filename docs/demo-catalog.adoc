== About the demo catalog [[about-demo-catalog]]

The demo resources that are demonstrated in the various showrooms here are, or will be, automatically harvested to and thus published via https://demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/[the demo catalog]. 

The demo catalog has the same functionalities as https://data.norge.no/[the National Data Catalog of Norway], but the content is only for testing or demonstration purposes.
