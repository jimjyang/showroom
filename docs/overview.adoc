== Overview and cross-references between the showrooms [[overview]]

*_Disclaimer_*: _The demo resources made available from the various showrooms are meant for demo purposes only._  

The *main purpose* of the showrooms is to

* demonstrate how to use the various RDF-based Norwegian national specifications to make available  machine-readable resources in accordance with the specifications; 
* demonstrate how to cross-reference/link between the resources across the specifications;
* provide machine-readable RDF-based resources, for testing and demonstration purposes. 

<<img-overiew>> illustrates some of the cross-references between the resource types that are demonstrated in the various showrooms. The cross-references will be explained in the respective showrooms.
