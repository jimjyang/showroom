== Overview and cross-references between the showrooms [[overview]]

The main purpose of these showrooms is to demonstrate how to use the various Norwegian RDF-based national specifications to describe and publish descriptions machine-readably, and to cross-reference/link between the resources across the specifications. 

<<img-overiew>> illustrates some of the cross-references between the resource types that are demonstrated in the showrooms.
