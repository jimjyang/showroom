=== URIs and dereferencing URI [[demo-uris]]

The "master key" to the showrooms is the URI. 

When making reusable and machine-readable information resources available, it is important to use unique and persistent identifiers. Conf. e.g. https://www.digdir.no/standarder/peikarar-til-offentlege-ressursar-pa-nett/1492[the Norwegian URI-standard, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (in Norwegian only). 

In this showroom we will demonstrate one way to implement the above-mentioned URI-standard, and how to dereference URIs to accessible online resources.
