== Demo information models

This part of the testbed is meant to demonstrate the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no[the Norwegian application profile of DCAT (ModellDCAT-AP-NO)], for describing information models.

It contains 

* a https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimjyang/testbed/main/modelldcat-ap-no/catalog-of-demo-models.ttl[RDF Turtle file] with demo information models illustrating the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no[ModellDCAT-AP-NO]
** The demo models are automatically harvested to and thus published via the https://demo.fellesdatakatalog.digdir.no/informationmodels?q=demo[demo catalog]. 
** These demo models are currently meant to 
*** demonstrate how to describe an information model in accordance with https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no[ModellDCAT-AP-NO], at the model level (i.e., without describing the model elements), and how to link to online resources of the model where more descriptions of the model may be found.
*** demonstrate how to describe relations between information models, in accordance with https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no[ModellDCAT-AP-NO].   
*** be referenced to as machine-readable RDF resources, for testing and demonstration purposes.
