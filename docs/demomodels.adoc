=== Information models [[demo-models]]

In this showroom we will demonstrate the usage of https://data.norge.no/specification/modelldcat-ap-no[ModellDCAT-AP-NO, window="_blank", role="ext-link"] (the Norwegian application profile of DCAT, for describing information models), to describe and publish machine-readable descriptions of information models, with cross-references to some of the other demo resources covered by the other specifications.
